CommunIT is a web-based community management application superimposed upon Google Maps. 

The application is focused on allowing residents within a community (e.g. neighborhood) to view the information of the residents around them. 

The application integrates the Google Maps API and is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, PHP, a MySQL database, and Bootstrap for a responsive design.
